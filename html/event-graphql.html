        <p>Although REST API architecture used to be great feature for server-client communication once it was introduced, there are still persisting issues issues about it. Namely, data under- and overfetching and necessity to make subsequent following queries to obtain all needed information. GraphQL brings a modern solution to these problems. As a “middle layer” between frontend and backend it utilizes custom schema to convert easy-to-understand user’s queries into instructions for communication with databases. GraphQL service extracts from the response exactly the piece of data client’s needs and provides it with just single query. Therefore it keeps server-client communication on minimal level, improving overall performance. Similarly to REST GraphQL is more specification than defined programming tool. It can be used widely on different environments serving as universal solution for data communication.</p>
